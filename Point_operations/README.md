# Histogram Matching Using Reference CDF

## Overview
This project demonstrates histogram matching, a point operation in image processing, to make the histogram of a test image similar to that of a reference image. The process is implemented in `Point_operations/dev.py` using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.

## Methodology
1. **Image Loading**: The script loads a reference image (`ref_220192J.jpg`) and a test image (`test5_220192J.jpg`) in grayscale mode.

2. **Histogram and CDF Calculation**: For both images, the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) are computed.

3. **Histogram Matching**: A mapping (lookup table) is created so that the CDF of the processed test image matches the CDF of the reference image as closely as possible. This is achieved by finding, for each intensity value in the test image, the corresponding intensity in the reference image with a similar CDF value.

4. **Image Transformation**: The test image is transformed using the mapping, resulting in a processed image whose histogram closely resembles that of the reference image.

5. **Visualization**: The script visualizes and compares the PDFs and CDFs of the reference, test, and processed images. It also displays the images side by side for qualitative assessment.

6. **Output**: The processed image is saved as `processed_image.jpg`.

## Key Functions in `dev.py`
- `histogram_pdf_cdf_calculator(image)`: Calculates the PDF and CDF of an image.
- `histogram_match(ref_cdf, test_cdf)`: Builds a mapping to match the test image's histogram to the reference image's CDF.

## Results
- The processed image's histogram and CDF closely match those of the reference image, demonstrating successful histogram matching.
- Visualizations generated by the script help to compare the distributions and the visual appearance of the images before and after processing.

## Applications
Histogram matching is useful in image processing tasks such as normalization, style transfer, and medical imaging, where consistent appearance across images is required.
